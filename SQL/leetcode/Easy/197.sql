Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).




SOLUTION: 


# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH FIRST_TABLE AS (
    SELECT id, recordDate, temperature,
    LAG(temperature, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) as prev_day_temperature,
    LAG(recordDate, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) as prev_record_day
    FROM Weather
)

SELECT id 
FROM FIRST_TABLE 
WHERE temperature > prev_day_temperature
AND  recordDate = DATE_ADD(prev_record_day, INTERVAL 1 DAY);
