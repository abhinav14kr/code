Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |

Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.


SOLUTION: 

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT A.num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs as A 
INNER JOIN Logs as B on A.id + 1 = B.id
INNER JOIN Logs as C on B.id + 1 = C.id
WHERE A.num = B.num 
AND B.num = C.num
;
