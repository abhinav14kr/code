This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
 

Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.


SOLUTION: 


-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
With FIRST_CTE AS (
    SELECT requester_id as id 
    FROM RequestAccepted 
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT accepter_id as id 
    FROM RequestAccepted 
)

SELECT id, COUNT(id) as num 
FROM FIRST_CTE 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC 
LIMIT 1 ;
