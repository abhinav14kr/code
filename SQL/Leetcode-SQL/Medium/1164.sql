(product_id, change_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
 

Write a solution to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

Return the result table in any order.

SOLUTION: 

-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below

WITH FIRST_CTE AS (
    SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY PRODUCT_ID ORDER BY CHANGE_DATE DESC) AS ranked
    FROM PRODUCTS 
    WHERE CHANGE_DATE <= '2019-08-16'
)

SELECT DISTINCT product_id, new_price as price 
FROM FIRST_CTE 
WHERE ranked = 1
UNION 
SELECT product_id, 10 as price
FROM Products 
WHERE product_id NOT IN (SELECT product_id FROM FIRST_CTE);
